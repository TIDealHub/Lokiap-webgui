# `$ Lokiap-webgui` [![Release 1.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-1.7-green.svg)](https://github.com/necro-nemesis/raspap-webgui/releases)

LokiAP interfaces witht Lokinet daemon to facilitate connections to the the Lokinet global privacy network. LokiAP provides a simple, responsive web interface to control wifi, hostapd, Lokinet daemon and related services necessary to access Lokinet on the Raspberry Pi or Orange Pi.

### WHAT IS LOKI?

https://loki.network/

"Loki is a privacy network which will allow users to transact and communicate privately over the internet, providing a suite of tools to help maintain the maximum amount of anonymity possible while browsing, transacting and communication online. Using the decentralised nature of blockchain technology, Loki creates new private and secure methods of interacting with the internet, as well as building privacy-centric applications, such as messaging services, forums, online marketplaces, and social media platforms."

## Prerequisites
Start with a clean install of the [latest release of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (currently Stretch). Raspbian Stretch Lite is recommended.

For Orange Pi Zero use Armbian Stretch found here: https://dl.armbian.com/orangepizero/

For Orange Pi R1 use Armbian Stretch found here: https://dl.armbian.com/orangepi-r1/

Burn the image to an SD card on your PC using Etcher:
https://www.balena.io/etcher/

##Preparing the image

For Raspbian you will need to remove the SD card from the computer, reinsert it, open the boot directory up and create a new textfile file named "ssh" with no .txt file extension i.e. just "ssh" in order to remotely connect. This step is not required for Armbian.

Insert the SD card into the device and power it up.

##Accessing the device

Obtain a copy of Putty:
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

1.  Log into your router from your PC and find the address it assigned to the Pi.

2.  Start Putty up and enter this address into Putty with settings:

3.  Host Name Address "<address obtained from router>" Port "22" and connection type "SSH" then "OPEN"

For Raspbian the default login is "root" password "raspberry"
For Armbian the default login is "root" password "1234"

4.  Follow any first user password instructions provided once logged in.

5. Update Raspbian/Armbian, including the kernel and firmware, followed by a reboot:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
6. Set the WiFi country in raspi-config's / armbian-config's **Localisation Options**: `sudo raspi-config` or 'sudo arbmian-config' for RasperryPi or OrangePi respectively.

7. If you have an older Raspberry Pi without an onboard WiFi chipset, the [**Edimax Wireless 802.11b/g/n nano USB adapter**](https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/global/wireless_adapters_n150/ew-7811un) is an excellent option â€“ it's small, cheap and has good driver support.

With the prerequisites done, you can proceed with either the Quick installer or Manual installation steps below.

## Quick installer

Install LokiAP from shell prompt:
```sh
$ wget -q https://git.io/fjeSw -O /tmp/raspap && bash /tmp/raspap
```
The installer will complete the steps in the manual installation (below) for you.

After the reboot at the end of the installation the wireless network will be
configured as an access point as follows:
* IP address: 10.3.141.1
  * Username: admin
  * Password: secret
* DHCP range: 10.3.141.1 to 10.3.141.24
* SSID: `loki-access`
* Password: ChangeMe
